## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

adjusting asymetrical background is the thing this challenge asks, it took me a lot of time to get it because i got confused with colors of provided background image, i though i have to change the color of it, so i was trying how to set them to not change the color, when i found a way and injected the image in code, because of its color i didn't need to do any of the thing i planned.

in this i got learned to inject some icons from web.

and how to change the color of text of provided images and icons.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
